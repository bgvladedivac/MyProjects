A simple chat Node.js / Socket.io application for a college assignment.

Current functionality:
Users could send instant messages to each other + each message has a username + time stamp.

Missing functionality:
Not updating the available users on disconnected event.

Buggy functionality:
On a login, the previous users got appended all the logged users again.

Deployment dependencies:
You need to have 'docker' + 'docker-compose' installed.

Run:

'docker-compose up'
